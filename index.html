                I am an experienced professional with a Ph.D. in Operations
                Research from Texas A&M University, specializing in game theory,
                reinforcement learning, machine learning, and deep learning
                algorithms. My expertise extends to statistical analysis,
                artificial intelligence, and data-driven decision-making in
                complex systems. With a strong foundation in energy markets,
                infrastructure resiliency, and supply chain management, I focus
                on developing robust optimization models that drive efficiency
                and strategic growth. My work also includes designing and
                optimizing trading strategies for financial markets, leveraging
                advanced analytical techniques to navigate dynamic and uncertain
                environments.

                        restore service in a disrupted infrastructure network
                        with incomplete fault information. We model the problem
                        as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process and develop
                        a reinforcement learning-based solution, incorporating
                        structural results to eliminate suboptimal moves and
                        state aggregation techniques to manage complexity.
                        Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
                        of our approach across various parameter settings
                        compared to benchmark methods

                        In this paper, we examine how electricity markets
                        implicitly price flexibility through persistent
                        day-ahead premiums, which arise due to the risk of
                        low-probability but high-impact disruptions. Using a
                        two-stage game-theoretic model, we demonstrate that
                        arbitrageurs' participation is constrained by downside
                        risk, enabling flexible generators to exert market power
                        by withholding capacity. Furthermore, we show that as
                        arbitrageur participation increases, suppliers' expected
                        returns decline more sharply, while arbitrageurs'
                        returns become increasingly suppressed.

                        This study applies a graph theory framework to construct
                        a tracking portfolio by modeling assets as nodes and
                        correlations as weighted edges. Using Minimum Dominating
                        Sets (MDS), we efficiently manage large portfolios,
                        solving the NP-hard problem with integer linear
                        programming (Gurobi solver) and heuristic algorithms
                        (greedy and stochastic local search). Computational
                        results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
                        capturing expected returns while significantly reducing
                        computation time.

                        We study an investor’s portfolio optimization problem
                        under a drawdown constraint in a market with local
                        stochastic volatility. The investor seeks to maximize
                        the expected utility of terminal wealth relative to the
                        maximum wealth achieved over a fixed horizon, with asset
                        selection guided by pairs trading. Since closed-form
                        solutions for the value function and optimal strategy
                        are unavailable, we approximate them using coefficient
                        series expansion and finite difference methods,
                        leveraging a risk tolerance function to simplify
                        computations and compare stochastic versus constant
                        volatility scenarios.

                    We implement two exact algorithms—the Branch & Cut (BC)
                    Algorithm and the Combinatorial Branch & Bound (A2)
                    Algorithm when s = 2.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The BC algorithm leverages column generation techniques,
                    solving a restricted master problem (RMP) iteratively while
                    generating valid inequalities (cuts) to refine solutions. It
                    is particularly efficient for dense graphs and can handle up
                    to 205 nodes efficiently, though performance declines as
                    graph density decreases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On the other hand, the A2 algorithm follows a hereditary
                    structure approach that systematically explores subgraphs
                    using Russian Doll Search (RDS) with backtracking, making it
                    more suitable for sparse graphs but computationally
                    intensive for graphs beyond 50 nodes due to memory
                    constraints.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Computational experiments using Erdős–Rényi random graphs
                    confirm that BC is more scalable, whereas A2 provides strong

                    This project focuses on developing predictive models for
                    credit card default using various machine learning
                    techniques. By addressing data imbalance, selecting
                    significant features, and evaluating multiple
                    models—including logistic regression, decision trees, random
                    forests, neural networks, and support vector machines—the
                    study identifies the most effective approach for accurate
                    predictions. Performance metrics such as ROC curves,
                    misclassification rates, and lift charts highlight the
                    strengths.

                    The Credit card data has an imbalanced distribution. We
                    performed down sampling to create a balanced dataset.
                    Chi-Square analysis was used to determine the most
                    significant variables affecting the target variable. No
                    missing values were found, so imputation was not required.
                    We used 70% of data for training and 30% for validation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We applied Logistic Regression using Stepwise, Forward, and
                    Backward selection methods. In Stepwise Regression, we
                    iteratively added or removed variables to find the best
                    model. In Forward Selection, we started with an empty model
                    and added variables based on improvements in Akaike’s
                    Information Criterion (AIC). In Backward Selection, we
                    started with all variables and removed the least significant
                    ones. The results showed that Stepwise Selection achieved
                    70.21% accuracy on the training set and 70.56% on the
                    validation set, while Forward and Backward Selection
                    provided similar accuracy (~70.44% on the validation set).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We applied decision trees (Two-Branch, Four-Branch, and
                    Interactive). In the Two-Branch Decision Tree, 11 leaf nodes
                    provided the best balance between training and validation
                    accuracy. In the Four-Branch Decision Tree, 175 leaves
                    provided the best fit on the validation data. Lastly, the
                    Interactive Decision Tree found 22 leaves to be the optimal
                    stopping point.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Next, we used the Random Forest to ensemble multiple
                    decision trees to improve performance. We used 100 trees for
                    training and obtained validation accuracy of 71.40%, which
                    was better than logistic regression and decision trees.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In Neural Network, we used Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
                    model with 6 hidden layers. Used a high learning rate with
                    momentum. We obtained a validation accuracy of 71.19% which
                    is slightly lower than Random Forest but better than
                    Decision Trees.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally, we tested the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
                    Polynomial Kernel of degree 2 and obtained a validation
                    accuracy of 70.34%.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To compare and validate the models, we used the following
                    indices: ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic),
                    Cumulative Lift (Lift Chart), Gini Coefficient,
                    Misclassification Rate, Average Squared Error, Response
                    Percentage, and Lift and Gain Values. Our observations
                    showed that Random Forest performed the best overall,
                    achieving the highest ROC score and the lowest
                    misclassification rate. The Neural Network performed well in
                    terms of error minimization, yielding the lowest average
                    squared error. While SVM and Logistic Regression delivered
                    decent performance, they were outperformed by ensemble
                    methods (Random Forest) and deep learning models.

                    role of swaps in derivative markets and structured finance.

                  <p class="description">
                    Many found the lecture pacing to be well-structured and felt
                    that the review sessions were particularly helpful in
                    preparing for exams. While students valued the extra credit
                    opportunities, some suggested that quizzes should carry less
                    weight in the overall grading scheme. Overall, the feedback
                    highlights a well-organized course with fair grading and
                    supportive review sessions that aid student learning.
                    Students expressed their appreciation for the practical
                    applications and support provided throughout the course.
